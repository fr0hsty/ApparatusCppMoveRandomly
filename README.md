# ApparatusCppMoveRandomly
Hey there! 
This repo contains BOTH c++ and BP examples to acheive the same logic, but in each frameworks specific ways. I intend to split the BP portion off into a second repository - but until then, for BP users:

2. Delete the entire source folder
3. Delete cppExample MAP
4. Delete CPPExample FOLDER
5. Open bpExample MAP
6. Play!

This github results in the following randomly moving subjects built in c++ OR BP with Apparatus:
